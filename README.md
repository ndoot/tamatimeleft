The Savings Cat-culator is a web-app designed to make budgeting approachable and fun
for teenagers and young adults!

## Motivations and current features
While existing budgeting apps are very comprehensive, their features often make
budgeting feel complicated and intimidating. We wanted to:
1. simplify budgeting to its core needs,
2. make it easier for users to save more, and
3. make the whole process fun!

Users enter their current savings, income and expenses into the app, and are
able to easily visualise a snapshot of their finances. Gerald the cat also acts 
as a guide to point out whether users might be spending more than they are earning,
and how they can get their budget under control.

The app focuses on encouraging users to spend less than they earn. When users are 
spending _more_ than they earn, they can see exactly how long they have before
their savings will run out.

The recommendations made by Gerald are based on minimising spending on "Wants"
eg. restaurants, entertainment, etc. We highlight the biggest spending categories so
that users can easily see where they can cut down on non-essential expenses.

With elements of gamification (the more you save, the more items you can buy),
we hope that users will look forward to keeping their budgets in check!

## Future features
1. Integration with bank accounts - savings, income and expenses can be auto filled
2. Creation of an account to track spending habits over time
3. Ability to set savings goals, with special items made available when those goals are reached
4. More customisation and animations with items for Gerald eg. Gerald eating the salmon, Gerald having clothes, Gerald on a tropical beach
5. Responsive for mobile
6. Smarter recommendations
